## Linux Environment 


## Vim and vscode are the preferred text editors along side Jupyter lab and Spyder

### For development aspects use Qt creator open source as the IDE 
#### Installed kite as main autocomplete plugin .
#### copy paste
##### curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim    
    from vim-plug git hub repo to vim directory in home

#### Installed zsh along with ohmyzsh and change theme to agnoster which is my favourite 
check on ohmyzsh gitrepo 
##### Also used inconsolata powerline fonts for more aesthetic terminal appeal and also installed WPS office for documentation
###### (for that purpose also installed msttcorefonts  "sudo apt install msttcorefonts" / "sudo pacman -S msttcorefonts")
