# config-files
A set of config_files to ease up the work flow

## Linux Environment 


## Vim and vscode are the preferred text editors along side Jupyter lab and Spyder

### For development aspects use Qt creator open source as the IDE 
#### Installed kite as main autocomplete plugin .
#### Installed zsh along with ohmyzsh and change theme to agnoster which is my favourite 
##### Also used inconsolata powerline fonts for more aesthetic terminal appeal and also installed WPS office for documentation
###### (for that purpose also installed msttcorefonts  "sudo apt install msttcorefonts" / "sudo pacman -S msttcorefonts")
